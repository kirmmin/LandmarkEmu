# LandmarkEmu*

## Introduction
A server emulator for the, now sunset MMORPG, Landmark. Written in C#, this version of the server will support the latest build (v0.695.1.132647) as it was at shutdown.

## Requirements
- Visual Studio 2022 (.NET Core 6 and C# 10 support required)

## Remarks
- Big thanks to Rawaho and the crew at [NexusForever](https://github.com/NexusForever/NexusForever), which this server framework is heavily based on.
- Mange tak til jseidelin! Alongside the other psemu contributors, they have provided the base library [soe-network](https://github.com/psemu/soe-network) which the network stack is based upon.
